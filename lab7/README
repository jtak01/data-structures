The bigThree were implemented. Destructor was implemented by implementing a helper
function. This function just deletes all nodes in the linked list and then
sets the front to NULL. Copy constructor copies the Linked List into the new 
object from the old object. By copying the front variables it has its own pointer
to the linked list. The assignement operator was implemented very closely to the 
copy constructor. But here, it first checks if the object the assignment operator
is called on is the same as the &source parameter. If it is not the same it will
delete everything in this and then copy the &source over into this.
