# data-structures
My past work done at Tufts using data structures. A portfolio of some sort. Course Number: COMP15

Any folders that start with "lab" are work done in lab sessions in school. We are given some base code to start from and make some changes
so that the program works as the original's author's intentions. 

So far the files on here are in C++.
However, I am also proficient in Java, Javascript, Python, C, HTML, and, CSS.
