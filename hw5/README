NOTE: This homework is not finished. I tried my best and poured in hours upon hours
but I was not able to finish it before the deadline. Thus, when submitting this, it 
is not complete. Actor class is fully implemented, Graph class is mostly modified 
excpet for the report_path function. SixDegree class is also partially implemented,
run is not implemented.
	In unit-test.cpp there are code in there but it was only to test my program as I was programming it, so not all the functions are tested. 
compile with clang++ -Wall -Wextra -std=c++11 -g Graph.cpp main.cpp Actor.cpp SixDegree.cpp Queue.cpp

To run unit test, change main.cpp to unit-test.cpp

This homework assignment contains a partial implementation of Graph BFS traversal.


main.cpp                : main driver of the project. Creates and 'run's an instance of SixDegrees 
Graph.cpp               : graph class with extra helping tools to run DFS
Graph.h                 : interface of graph class above
LinkedList.cpp          : simple template linked list class used for DFS
LinkedList.h            : interface of Linked list class above
NodeType.h              : interface of Nodetype class (a simple struct used in the linked list class)
Stack.cpp               : simple template stack class used for DFS
Stack.h                 : interface of Stack class above
Queue.cpp               : simple template queue class used for DFS
Queue.h                 : interface of Queue class above
actors.txt              : sample list of actors and the movies they have been in
test_input.txt          : sample test input for the algorithm
the_sixdegrees          : reference implementation for students to use as reference
README                  : this file

Note: the code is not complete on purpose. Students must create several files as implement some functions in Graph
      class as well as the main driver.
